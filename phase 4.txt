Here is the code displayed in your second image:

from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# Simple dataset: [rainfall_mm, river_level_m]
X = [
    [100, 4.5],  # Flood
    [70, 1.2],   # No Flood
    [120, 5.5],  # Flood
    [50, 2.0],   # No Flood
    [130, 4.8]   # Flood
]

# Labels: 1 = Flood, 0 = No Flood
y = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

# Train a simple Decision Tree model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict flood risk for new weather input
new_input = [[90, 4.0]]  # 90mm rainfall, 4m river
prediction = model.predict(new_input)

# Print outcome
print("Flood Prediction (1=Flood, 0=No Flood):", prediction[0])

The model is trained to predict the risk of a flood based on rainfall and river level. In this case, the input [90, 4.0] yields a prediction of 1, which means a flood is predicted.
